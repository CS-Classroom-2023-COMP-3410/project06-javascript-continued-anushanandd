I decided to work on and improve Project 10, the Customizable Keyboard Trainer. The feature I attempted to add was to make the target text light gray and have each character change color (red for incorrect, green for correct) after the user typed a key. This was opposed to having the target text and the top and a input text box underneath. This feature would improve the UI and be better feedback for the user. When prompting ChatGPT for the first time, the program had an "error" where it said the test was complete right when it was loaded. After a couple more attempts, the problem was resolved, but there was another bug where when starting the typing test, clicking space would restart the test. ChatGPT then resolved this problem, but then there was another problem where the test would never finish and show the output screen. At this point, I stopped prompting after a total 6 attempts for this feature.
